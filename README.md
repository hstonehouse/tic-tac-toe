# HOW TO PLAY
Click on a square to insert 'X'. You are now Player 1.
The second player can now click another square to insert 'O'. Note that players cannot click a square that is already filled in.
The player tracker at the bottom keeps track of whose turn it is by highlighting the relevant box red.
Players win the game by having three Xs or Os in a row - vertically, horizontally or diagonally.
When a player wins, the three winning boxes turn green, and the player tracker at the bottom displays the winner.
If the game is a draw, none of the boxes turn green and the player tracker at the bottom says "It's a draw!".

After the game ends (either by someone winning or a draw), a "Play Again" button will appear. If you click the button, the board will clear and a new game will begin, and this time Player 2 will start. The player who starts the game will alternate each time. Remember that you can keep track of whose turn it is by looking at which box is highlighted red.
